Hi there! ðŸ‘‹ Iâ€™m Darcy220606 (*aka.* Anan)

ðŸ™‡ Iâ€™m a biotechnologist by training, who drifted towards Computational Biology, Bioinformatics and Data Science through the years. I just fell in love with transforming messy, complex data into meaningful stories. Whether itâ€™s analyzing ancient DNA to uncover the hidden secrets from centuries past or building tools to hunt antimicrobial peptides, I enjoy diving into the world of data and making it accessible to others. 

What Iâ€™ve Been Up To:

- ðŸ”¦ Building [AmpCombi](https://github.com/Darcy220606/AMPcombi), a tool that transforms millions of antimicorbial hits into a manageable shortlist with a user-friendly GUI to explore the output.

- ðŸš€ Developing bioinformatics pipelines [FuncScan](https://github.com/nf-core/funcscan) to predict antimicrobial peptides, antibiotic resistance genes, and biosynthetic gene clusters using containerized workflows in [nf-core](https://nf-co.re/).

- ðŸ§¬ Working on ancient metagenomic data to understand microbial communities, their functions, and their response to environmental change. Assisted towards compiling a database for ancient metagenomes; [AncientMetagenomeDir](https://github.com/SPAAM-community/AncientMetagenomeDir).

âœ¨ Iâ€™m always open to new opportunities that allow me to grow, apply my skills in Research Software Engineering (RSE), and contribute to exciting, interdisciplinary projects. 

If I'm not working on the above you'll find me always up to something somewhere making memories ðŸ”¥ðŸ’¥ Up for a chat, just hit me up [here](https://www.linkedin.com/in/anan-ibrahim-58b716130/).
